## Audio Widget Sample

In this tutorial we leverage native javascript for access to the PC microphone and give ourselves the ability to record a wav file, and convert it to a play on an IVR platform. From there, within this simple app, we fetch all our wav files on our tenant and have the ability to replace.update any of our files.
